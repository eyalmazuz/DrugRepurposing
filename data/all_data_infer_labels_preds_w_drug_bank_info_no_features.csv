ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney [T28]. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.

Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH [A31661]. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate [A31662]. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate.

As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. 

More specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine [A32836]. 

Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [A32837]. 

Pyridoxine is used medically for the treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and for the prophylaxis of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy (due to [DB00951]'s mechanism of action which competitively inhibits the action of pyridoxine in the above-mentioned metabolic functions).

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]",True

Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.

The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients.[A180583] According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example.[L7264]

The benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir. 

Notably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a ""core"" drug to a ""complementary"" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.[A179086] Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure.",False

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]",False

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]",False

Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 [A175333], mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on.

Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.[A178090] Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.[A18262] This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255].[A18262] Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 

Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).[L6037] However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018].

Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]",False

Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]

In response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T<sub>4</sub>, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5′-deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite T<sub>3</sub>. While T<sub>4</sub> is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T<sub>3</sub> exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]

THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation.

Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]

Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.

Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]

First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]

While ritonavir is not an active antiviral agent against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it is added in combination therapies indicated for treatment of HCV infections as a booster. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as [DB09297] and overall drug exposure.

Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33).

It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]

The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]",False

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.",False

Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.

Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.

Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.[A186286] For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,[A186298] and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.[A186263,A186266,A186269]

Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]

Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl]. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.[A186295]",False

More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors. When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils. If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death. Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose. It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam]. 

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion. Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of ""kits"", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community. Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.

When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within 3-5 minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms. Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea. Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.

Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine]. Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction. When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine. The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.",False

Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about 5 mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium. Low calcium intake may also be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis.

However, in 1962, after the discovery of an unacceptable incidence of agranulocytosis, the development of Monase was halted and the drug was withdrawn from potential market use. 

In 1993, the US Drug Enforcement Administration added αET to Schedule I of its Schedules of Controlled Substances, after an increasing incidence of its use as a recreational drug in the 1980's. Currently, αET is an illegal substance; however, it's activity is still under scientific investigation. 

αET is a stimulant and hallucinogen, but it is less stimulating and hallucinogenic than alpha-methyltryptamine, a closely related compound. Instead, the effects of αET, a tryptamine derivative, more closely resemble the amphetamine derived drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA).

It is used as an appetite suppressant and a treatment for obesity. It is listed as an illicit substance in many countries due to addiction issues and listed as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Structurally, fenproporex (N-2-cyanoethylamphetamine) falls within the phenylethamine and amphetamine chemical class of drugs. The N-2-cyanoethyl substituent was once believed to be resistant to cleavage, because fenproporex -- once recommended as an obesity treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease -- was originally claimed to lack stimulant properties. Contrary to the claim, research has demonstrated easy in vivo cleavage of the N-2-cyanothyl substituent to yield amphetamine as a metabolite. [5] However, in clinical practice, central nervous system stimulative effects are less notorious than with some other agents such as diethylpropion and mazindol. [7]

In the United States fenproporex was never approved by the FDA for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. In 2006 and 2009, the FDA issued warnings that it had been detected in diet pills sold online, and imported from foreign manufacturers.

Despite being banned in the United States, fenproporex has been described as the second most commonly consumed appetite suppressant worldwide, [6] with fenproporex containing anorectics still being commonly prescribed in South America. Little is known about the specific hazards of amphetamine based diet pills, however case reports have noted side effects such as chest pain, palpitations, headaches, and insomnia. In addition, placebo controlled studies have shown that participants using fenproporex experience more joint pain, sweating, blurred vision and tremor. [2]",False

A newer study suggests implies that an imbalance of zinc is associated with the neuronal damage associated with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and seizures [A32465].

 Understanding the mechanisms that control brain zinc homeostasis is, therefore, imperative to the development of preventive and treatment regimens for these and other neurological disorders [A32465].

In addition to the above, recent review articles have already demonstrated the important role of zinc in the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders, plus discussed the potential value of zinc as a marker of these diseases [L2097].

The trans- form can undergo isomerisation to the cis- form when heated or exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. In a 2004 issue of Science, Dr. Sinclair of Harvard University said resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation. It has been claimed that it is readily degraded by exposure to light, heat, and oxygen.

Dronedarone is a related benzofuran compound to amiodarone but its chemical structure lacks iodine moieties which are associated with amiodarone-induced thyroid problems.[A34604,T28] Additionally, the methyl sulfonyl group in its structure renders dronedarone to be more lipophilic with a shorter half-life than amiodarone.[A34604] This ultimately leads to reduced tissue accumulation of the drug and decreased risk for organ toxicities, such as thyroid and pulmonary toxicities.[T28] Commonly marketed as Multaq®, dronedarone was approved by the FDA in July 2009 and Health Canada in August 2009.

Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 

Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 

Dexlansoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion [A177574].",False

Nylidrin is utilized to treat several disorders that may benefit from increased blood flow (for example, certain mental disorders, blood vessel disease due to diabetes, frostbite, night leg cramps, and certain types of ulcers). This medication works by dilating (widening) blood vessels to help increase blood flow (improving circulation) throughout the body, including the extremities and central nervous system.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. 

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-naïve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].

Simeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].

Simeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-naïve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.",True

This forms as large, bright blue crystals containing five molecules of water (CuSO4∙5H2O) and is also known as _blue vitriol_. The anhydrous salt is created by heating the hydrate to 150 °C (300 °F). Cupric sulfate is used primarily for agricultural purposes, as a pesticide, germicide, feed additive, and soil additive. Some of its secondary uses are as a raw material in the preparation of other copper compounds, as a reagent in analytic chemistry, as an electrolyte for batteries and electroplating baths, and in medical practice as a locally applied fungicide, bactericide, and astringent [L1820].

Copper is an essential trace element and an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. After zinc and iron, copper is the third most abundant trace element found in the human body. Copper is a noble metal and its properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloying ability, and malleability.  Copper is a component of intrauterine contraceptive devices  (IUD) and the release of copper is necessary for their important contraceptive effects. The average daily intake of copper in the USA is approximately  1 mg Cu with the diet being a primary source [A32221].

Interestingly, the dysregulation of copper has been studied with a focus on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Wilson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Data from clinical observations of the neurotoxic effects of copper may provide the basis for future treatments affecting copper and its homeostasis [L1830].",False

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin's potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as ""good cholesterol"").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]",False

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].",True

Binding at the LBD of the agonists glycine (or D-serine) to the GluN1 subunits and of glutamate to the GluN2 subunits is a regulatory mechanism for channel activation. In addition, allosteric modulators are known to bind at the NTDs and form another layer of regulation.[A220118, A220128] One such allosteric regulator is ifenprodil, which was first shown to bind the NMDARs in the 1990s, and specifically to those NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit.[A220133] Further studies elucidated that ifenprodil binds strongly at the inter-subunit interface of adjacent GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs, where it acts as a non-competitive antagonist.[A220118, A220128]

Although ifenprodil has received considerable interest in its potential neuromodulatory activities in psychiatric conditions, including dependency[A220138] and depression,[A220143] it has also been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect.[A220143, A196128] In an unbiased screen for compounds capable of reducing cell death induced by infection with the influenza strain H5N1, ifenprodil was found to have a protective effect against H5N1-induced lung damage, in part through its ability to alleviate the H5N1-induced cytokine storm and reduce pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T cells.[A196128] Ifenprodil is being investigated for its potential utility in treating COVID-19 in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT04382924).[L16343]",False

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as ledipasvir. More specifically, ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-Structural Protein 5A (NS5A), which is required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated to prevent hyperphosphorylation of NS5A which is required for viral protein production. It is effective against genotypes 1a, 1b, 4a, and 5a and with a lesser activity against genotypes 2a and 3a of HCV. Ledipasvir and other direct acting antivirals are very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend ledipasvir as a first line therapy option in combination with [sofosbuvir] for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 4, 5, and 6 [L852]. Treatment with ledipasvir is used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as ledipasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, ledipasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [sofosbuvir] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [ribavirin] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label]. When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [FDA Label]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].",True

It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant's extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses [A32477, A32469]. CBD's exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' (and CBD's) diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many other bodily systems. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585,A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), [DB14050] (CBDV), and [DB11755] (THCV) that can be found within the medical cannabis [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms of THC like [DB00470] or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

The primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety[A32469]. 

In addition to the well-known activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors, there is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A/2A/3A serotonergic and TRPV1–2 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2+ stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) [A31555, A31574].

CBD is currently available in Canada within a 1:1 formulation with tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) (as the formulation known as ""nabiximols"") as the brand name product Sativex. It is approved for use as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sativex was also given a conditional Notice of Compliance (NOC/c) for use as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adult patients with multiple sclerosis and as adjunctive analgesic treatment for moderate to severe pain in adult patients with advanced cancer [L886].

In April 2018, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol oral solution) for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are among the two most difficult types of epilepsy to treat [L2721, L2719]. Epidiolex was granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track Approval from the FDA for further study in these hard to treat conditions. Notably, phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome [L2720]. On June 25th, 2018, Epidiolex was approved by the FDA to be the first CBD-based product available on the US market.",True

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients.

It is used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria (Xuriden), or for the emergency treatment of fluorouracil or capecitabine overdose or toxicity (Vistogard).  It is provided in the prodrug form as uridine triacetate as this form delivers 4- to 6-fold more uridine into the systemic circulation compared to equimolar doses of uridine itself. 

When used for the treatment or prevention of toxicity associated with fluorouracil and other antimetabolites, uridine triacetate is utilized for its ability to compete with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolites for incorporation into the genetic material of non-cancerous cells. It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). Normally, FdUMP inhibits thymidylate synthase required for thymidine synthesis and DNA replication and repair while FUTP incorporates into RNA resulting in defective strands. As a result, these metabolites are associated with various unpleasant side effects such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand–foot syndrome. Like many other neoplastic agents, these side effects limit the doses of 5-FU that can be administered, which also affects the efficacy for treatment. By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects [A18578]. It can also be used as a rescue therapy if severe side effects present within 96 hours after initiation of therapy. 

Uridine triacetate is also used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase deficiency. This rare congenital autosomal recessive disorder of pyrimidine metabolism is caused by a defect in uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. As a result of UMPS deficiency, patients experience a  systemic deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides, accounting for most symptoms of the disease. Additionally, orotic acid from the de novo pyrimidine pathway that cannot be converted to UMP is excreted in the urine, accounting for the common name of the disorder, orotic aciduria. Furthermore, orotic acid crystals in the urine can cause episodes of obstructive uropathy. When administered as the prodrug uridine triacetate, uridine can be used by essentially all cells to make uridine nucleotides, which compensates for the genetic deficiency in synthesis in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria. When intracellular uridine nucleotides are restored into the normal range, overproduction of orotic acid is reduced by feedback inhibition, so that urinary excretion of orotic acid is also reduced.",True

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as [DB08873], [DB05521], [DB00008], [DB00022], and [DB00811]. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains [A19593]. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).

More specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [FDA Label]. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [A19643]. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. 

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Paritaprevir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4[L852]. Depending on the genotype, Paritaprevir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09296], [DB09183], [DB00503], and [DB00811], with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as paritaprevir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Paritaprevir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB00503] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with [DB00811] for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.

Paritaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296] and [DB00503] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie.

This drug is available as a nutritional supplement to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 is a collective term for these variously substituted corrinoids. The principal biochemical participants are two coenzyme forms of Vitamin B12 that are produced and activated in two separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria [L2053].

Vitamin B12 (cyancobalamin, Cbl) has two active co-enzyme forms, _methylcobalamin (MeCbl)_ and _adenosylcobalamin (AdCbl)_. There has been a shift in the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency such that MeCbl is being extensively used and promoted. This exists despite the fact that both MeCbl and AdCbl are necessary for life and have vastly different metabolic fates and functions. MeCbl is mainly involved along with folate in hematopoiesis and the growth of the brain during childhood. Deficiency of AdCbl disturbs the carbohydrate, fat and amino-acid metabolism, and therefore interferes with the formation of myelin. It is therefore important to treat vitamin B12 deficiency with a combination of MeCbl and AdCbl or hydroxocobalamin or cobalamin [L2054].

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Velpatasvir acts as a defective substrate for NS5A (Non-Structural Protein 5A), a non-enzymatic viral protein that plays a key role in Hepatitis C Virus replication, assembly, and modulation of host immune responses [A19175]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as velpatasvir. Notably, velpatasvir has a significantly higher barrier to resistance than the first generation NS5A inhibitors, such as [DB09027] and [DB09102], making it a highly potent and reliable alternative for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C [A19637]. 

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Velpatasvir as first line therapy in combination with sofosbuvir for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Velpatasvir is currently only available within a fixed dose combination product as Epclusa with [DB08934], another direct acting antiviral. Goals of therapy for Epclusa include the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality and risk of requiring a liver transplant [A19626].

Since June 2016, Velpatasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB08934], as the commercially available product Epclusa. Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. It is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis and a high barrier to resistance [L852].

It is approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. It works by inhibiting fungal cell membrane synthesis. Invasive fungal infections pose significant clinical challenges for patients, especially those who are immunocompromised. In vitro, most of the _Candida_ species, most _Aspergillus_ species, Mucorales, _Cryptococcus_ spp., _Fusarium_ species, dermatophytes and dimorphic fungi displayed susceptibility to isavuconzaole [A32029]. Resistance to isavuconazole has been associated with the mutation in the target gene CYP51 [FDA Label]. Cross-resistance between isavuconazole and other azoles was also proposed although the clinical relevance is unclear [FDA Label]. 

As isavuconazole displays low water solubility, it is found as an active ingredient of its prodrug, [DB06636]. The prodrug formulation of isavuconazole is FDA- and EMA-approved and is marketed under the trade name Cresemba for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis as oral or intravenous administration. The intravenous formulation is cyclodextrin-free which gives isavuconazole an advantage over other azole antifungals that requires cyclodextrin for facilitating drug solubility; this is because cyclodextrin has a potential for nephrotoxicity [A32029]. It is proposed that the intravenous and oral dosing can be used interchangeably [L1482], without the need for a repeat loading dose when transitioning from an IV to an oral formulation [A32026].

The parent compound of rifamycin was rifamycin B which was originally obtained as a main product in the presence of diethylbarburitic acid. Some small modifications where performed in this inactive compound and with the creation of rifamycin SV there was the first antibiotic used intravenously for the treatment of tuberculosis.[A39990]

Rifamycin has had several direct derivative products such as rifamycin SV, rifaximin, rifampin and rifamycin CV. All of the derivatives have slight different physicochemical properties when compared to the parent structure.[A39986]

Rifamycin was further developed by Cosmo Technologies Ltd and approved in November 16, 2018 by the FDA as a prescription drug after being granted the designation of Qualified Infectious Disease Product which allowed it to have a status a priority review.[L4800] This drug was also sent for review to the EMA in 2015 by Dr. Falk Pharma Gmbh and it was granted a waiver for the tested conditions.[L4801]",False

Δ9-THC is currently available in several synthetic forms, including [Dronabinol], while purified or isolated THCV is not approved for any medical uses and is not available as any marketed products. As a major phytocannabinoid, however, THCV is accessible within [Medical Cannabis] along with other identified cannabinoids including [Cannabidiol] (CBD), [cannabinol] (CBN), [cannabigerol] (CBG), [cannabichromene] (CBC), [cannabivarin] (CBV), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV). 

THCV is one of four cannabinoids with identified potential as anticonvulsant agents, which also includes Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, [Cannabidiol] (CBD), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV) [A33334].

Although THCV possesses an almost identical structure to Δ9-THC (varying only by the length of its lipophilic alkyl chain), it has different molecular targets and pharmacological profile [A32972]. Compared to THC which demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity of both endocannabinoid receptors Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R), THCV acts as a CB1 antagonist and a partial agonist of CB2 [A32477]. Further evidence has also shown that THCV acts as an agonist of GPR55 and l-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) [A32974]. Beyond the endocannabinoid system, THCV has also been reported to activate 5HT1A receptors to produce an antipsychotic effect that has therapeutic potential for ameliorating some of the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia [A32975]. Furthermore, THCV interacts with different transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV2, which may contribute to the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts [A32976]. It has also shown antiepileptiform and anticonvulsant properties, that suggest possible therapeutic application in the treatment of pathophysiologic hyperexcitability states such as untreatable epilepsy [A33325].

Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many others. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion.

Janus kinases belong to the tyrosine protein kinase family and play an important role in the proinflammatory pathway signalling that is frequently over-activated in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. By blocking the actions of JAK1/2, baricitinib disrupts the activation of downstream signalling molecules and proinflammatory mediators. 

Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive autoimmune disease commonly associated with discomfort, diasability, and joint damage. Throughout disease progression, the disease may further lead to joint erosions and deformities, causing premature mortality, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life [A31386]. While there are several disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available for treatment, patients often experience inadequate threapeutic resposes to these drugs. In animal models of inflammatory arthritis, baricitinib was shown to have significant anti-inflammatory effects, but also led to preservation of cartilage and bone, with no detectable suppression of humoral immunity or adverse hematologic effects [A31382].

In the EU, baricitinib was approved in February of 2017 as a second-line orally administered treatment for moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults, either as a monotherapy or when combined with methotrexate. It is marketed under the trade name Olumiant.

Esketamine is the s-enantiomer of [Ketamine]. Ketamine is a mixture of two enantiomers (mirror image molecules). This is the first time that the FDA has approved esketamine for any use. The FDA approved ketamine (Ketalar) in 1970 [L5593].

Esketamine may prove to be a promising treatment for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder who have not experienced an improvement in symptoms despite treatment with various medications and therapies. The intranasal route of administration for this drug allows for easy administration and a fast onset of action, which sets it apart from many other antidepressant agents that may take several weeks to take effect.",False

Since PPD, like various other types of depression, is characterized by feelings of sadness, worthlessness or guilt, cognitive impairment, and/or possibly suicidal ideation, it is considered a life-threatening condition [F4072]. Studies have consequently found that PPD can genuinely have profound negative effects on the maternal-infant bond and later infant development [F4072, A176080, A176083]. The development and availability of brexanolone for the treatment of PPD in adult females subsequently provides a new and promising therapy where few existed before [F4066].

In particular, the use of brexanolone in treating PPD is surrounded with promise because it acts in part as a synthetic supplement for possible deficiencies in endogenous brexanolone (allopregnanolone) in postpartum women susceptible to PPD whereas many commonly used anti-depressive medications elicit actions that may modulate the presence and activity of substances like serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or monoamine oxidase but do not mediate activities directly associated with PPD like natural fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone [F4063].

And finally, although brexanolone may also be undergoing clinical trials to investigate its abilities to treat super-refractory status epilepticus, it appears that some such studies have failed to meet primary endpoints that compare success in the weaning of third-line agents and resolution of potentially life-threatening status epilepticus with brexanolone vs. placebo when added to standard-of-care [L5750].",False

The necessity for follow-up treatment may lead to challenges with patient adherence, and resistance to agents like permethrin and [pyrethrins]/[piperonyl butoxide] may be significant in some areas.[A216228] 

Investigations into novel ovicidal treatments revealed that several metalloproteinase enzymes were critical to the egg hatching and survival of head lice, and these enzymes were therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target.[A216178] Abemetapir is an inhibitor of these metalloproteinase enzymes, and the first topical pediculicide to take advantage of this novel target. The improved ovicidal activity (90-100% _in vitro_) of abemetapir allows for a single administration, in contrast to many other topical treatments, and its novel and relatively non-specific mechanism may help to curb the development of resistance to this agent.[A216178]

Patients with thrombocytopenia and chronic liver disease (leading to thrombocytopenia) often require platelet transfusions before surgical procedures to decrease the risk of bleeding [A33095].

Avatrombopag was approved by the FDA on May 21, 2018 for thrombocytopenia (low platelets) in adults with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure [L2931]. It is administered orally as _avatrombopag maleate_, its salt form [L2927].  

_Doptelet_ (Avatrombopag) is the first orally administered treatment option for patients with chronic liver disease,  allowing a large population of patients to avoid a platelet transfusion before a procedure by increasing platelet counts to the optimal level of greater or equal to 50,000 per microliter [L2932].",False

After completing various phase-II and phase-III trials demonstrating its effectiveness in treating moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris [A39993, A39994] the US Food and Drug Administration approved Barcelona based Almirall, S.A.'s Seysara (sarecylcine) as a new first in class narrow spectrum tetracycline derived oral antibiotic for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older [L4814]. Seysara (sarecycline) was originally part of Allergan's US Medical Dermatology portfolio, before Almirall acquired the portfolio in the second half of 2018 as a means of consolidating and reinforcing the dermatology-focused pharmaceutical company's presence in the United States [L4815].

Acne vulgaris itself is a common chronic skin condition associated with the blockage and/or inflammation of hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous glands [L4814]. The acne often presents physically as a mixture of non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions mainly on the face but on the back and chest as well [L4814]. Based upon data from Global Burden of Disease studies, the acne vulgaris condition affects up to 85% of young adults aged 12 to 25 years globally - with the possibility of permanent physical and mental scarring resulting from cases of severe acne [L4814].

Subsequently, while a number of first line tetracycline therapies like doxycycline and minocycline do exist for treating acne vulgaris, sarecycline presents a new and innovative therapy choice because it exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against relevant pathogens that cause acne vulgaris but also possesses a low propensity for resistance development in such pathogens and a narrower, more specific spectrum of antibacterial activity, resulting in fewer off-target antibacterial effects on endogenous intestinal flora and consequently fewer resultant adverse effects associated with diarrhea, fungal overgrowth, etc.",False

Brincidofovir is an oral antiviral drug candidate for the treatment of smallpox infections and complications resulting from smallpox vaccine. It is a lipid mimic of cidofovir formed by linking a lipid 3-hexadecyloxy-1-propanol, to the phosphonate group of cidofovir. Brincidofovir is designed to cross cellular membranes by passive diffusion (vida supra, Phospholipid Mimics Designed to Facilitate Uptake in the Small Intestine). Uptake by this mechanism should be more efficient and lead to a more rapid accumulation of cidofovir in the cytoplasm of the target cell. Once it has reached the cytoplasm, CDV is phosphorylated by host cell nucleoside kinases to form the active antiviral agent cidofovir diphosphate.",False

For its natural purpose, the male blister beetle secretes and presents the cantharidin to a female beetle as a copulatory gift during mating. Post-copulation, the female beetle places the cantharidin over her eggs as protection against any potential predators.

Available synthetically since the 1950s, topical applications of cantharidin have been used predominantly as a treatment for cutaneous warts since that time [A32891, A32892]. In 1962 however, marketers of cantharidin failed to produce sufficient efficacy data, resulting in the FDA revision of approval of cantharidin [A32892].

Today, topical cantharidin products do not necessarily demonstrate any particular better effectiveness at treating topical skin conditions like warts than other commonly available vesicant and/or keratolytics although various studies have also investigated the possibility of using cantharidin as an inflammatory model or in cancer treatment [A32892]. Regardless, the onging lack of FDA approval is likely related to certain toxic effects that were observed following oral ingestion, which includes ulceration of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, along with electrolyte and renal function disturbance in humans and animals [A32891].",True

The structure of plazomicin was established via appending hydroxylaminobutyric acid to [DB12604] at position 1 and 2-hydroxyethyl group at position 6' [A33942]. It was designed to evade all clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, which contribute to the main resistance mechanism for aminoglycoside therapy [A33942]. However, acquired resistance of aminoglycosides may arise through over expression of efflux pumps and ribosomal modification by bacteria, which results from amino acid or rRNA sequence mutations [A33942]. Like other aminoglycosides, plazomicin is ineffective against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases [FDA Label]. Plazomicin mediates the antibacterial activity against pathogens including carbapenem-resistant (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing _Enterobacteriaceae_. It mediates the antibacterial activity by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis [FDA Label]. On June 28th, 2018, plazomicin sulfate was approved by the FDA for use in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including Pyelonephritis.

More specifically, macimorelin is a peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts as an agonist of GH secretagogue receptor, or ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) to dose-dependently increase GH levels [A31481]. Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) represent a new class of pharmacological agents which have the potential to be used in numerous clinical applications. They include treatment for growth retardation in children and cachexia associated with chronic disease such as AIDS and cancer. 

Growth hormone (GH) is classically linked with linear growth during childhood. In deficiency of this hormone, AGHD is commonly associated with increased fat mass (particularly in the abdominal region), decreased lean body mass, osteopenia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance overtime. In addition, individuals with may be susceptible to cardiovascular complications from altered structures and function [A31484]. Risk factors of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset GH deficiency or with hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery, or irradiation to these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies [A31481]. While there are various therapies available such as GH replacement therapy, the absence of panhypopituitarism and low serum IGF-I levels with nonspecific clinical symptoms pose challenges to the detection and diagnosis of AGHD. The diagnosis of AGHD requires biochemical confirmation with at least 1 GH stimulation test [A31481]. Macimorelin is clinically useful since it displays good stability and oral bioavailability with comparable affinity to ghrelin receptor as its endogenous ligand. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects, macimorelin stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner with good tolerability [A31481].

Macimorelin, developed by Aeterna Zentaris, was approved by the FDA in December 2017 under the market name Macrilen for oral solution.",True

Its invention is credited to a collaboration between Russian scientists from several research institutes 40-50 years ago, and reports of its chemical synthesis date back to 1993.[A191475] Umifenovir's ability to exert antiviral effects through multiple pathways has resulted in considerable investigation into its use for a variety of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including _Flavivirus_,[A191388] Zika virus,[A191391] foot-and-mouth disease,[A191394] Lassa virus,[A191403] Ebola virus,[A191403] herpes simplex,[A191409], hepatitis B and C viruses, chikungunya virus, reovirus, Hantaan virus, and coxsackie virus B5.[A191475,A191412] This dual activity may also confer additional protection against viral resistance, as the development of resistance to umifenovir does not appear to be significant.[A191475]

Umifenovir is currently being investigated as a potential treatment and prophylactic agent for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2 infections in combination with both currently available and investigational HIV therapies.[A191385,A191550,L12012]",False

Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. Ester pro-drugs of estradiol are therefore considered to be bioidentical forms of estrogen [T84].

Estradiol acetate is commercially available as Femring, a vaginal ring used for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. Because of the difference in potency between estradiol and estrone, menopause (and a change in primary hormone from estradiol to estrone) is associated with a number of symptoms associated with this reduction in potency and in estrogenic effects. These include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood changes, irregular menses, chills, and sleeping problems. Administration of synthetic and bioidentical forms of estrogen, such as estradiol acetate, has shown to improve these menopausal symptoms.",False

In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, manufacturers typically convert the phenol component of the vitamin to esters using acetic or succinic acid, making a compound such as alpha-tocopherol succinate more stable and easier to use in vitamin supplements [A32956, A32957].

Alpha-tocopherol succinate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment, however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.

Moreover, although it is generally believed that alpha-tocopherol succinate would naturally demonstrate such general vitamin E-tocopherol pharmacodynamics after undergoing a logical de-esterification in the gut [A32956, A32957], there is ongoing research that proposes that the alpha-tocopherol succinate compound itself is capable of eliciting anti-cancer [L2699, A32959] and inflammation mediation [A32958] activities that are unique from the alpha-tocopherol form and other alpha-tocopherol esters [L2699, A32958, A32959].",True

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.",True

Sativex® is available in a 1:1 formulation of THC:CBD as an oro-mucosal pump spray used for treatment of neuropathic pain from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and for intractable cancer pain. Although still largely debated, Cannabis has been shown to have analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-psychotic activity [A32477, A32469]. 

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors found in the human body. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. While cannabis in its natural plant form is currently used ""off-label"" for the management of many medical conditions, THC is currently commercially available in synthetic form as [DB00486], as purified isomer as [DB00470], or in a 1:1 formulation with CBD from purified plant extract as [DB14011].

The primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site. The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects [A32469].

It is one of over 100 cannabinoids identified from the Cannabis plant that can modulate the physiological activity of cannabis, or marijuana [A32584]. Compared to its homolog, [DB09061], CBDV is shortened by two methyl (CH2) groups on its side chain. Notably, both [DB09061] and CBDV have demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in animal and human models and are demonstrating promising clinical trial results [A33327, A31560, A33328, A33329]. Other cannabinoids with some evidence of anti-epileptic activity include [DB11755] (THCV) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid.

While the primary components of cannabis, CBD and THC, have been shown to modulate many of their physiological effects through their binding to the cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, the investigational cannabinoids with anticonvulsant action mostly use mechanisms that do not involve these two endocannabinoid receptors.

The anti-epileptic activity of CBD and CBDV is thought to be modulated by their effects on transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1  (TRPV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, which is a member of a large family of ion channels that are involved in the onset and progression of several types of epilepsy. CBD and CBDV have been shown to dose-dependently activate and then desensitize TRPV1 as well as TRPV2 and TRPA1 channels [A31560, A33334, A32976]. Desensitization of these ion channels is a potential mechanism by which these molecules cause a reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to epileptic activity and seizures. 

CBDV has also been shown to inhibit the activity of diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase-α, the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) [A33296, A33347]. The clinical implications of this are unclear however, as this interaction has not been shown to affect CBDV's anticonvulsant activity.

Cannabidivarin is being actively developed by GW Pharmaceuticals as the experimental compound GWP42006 as it has ""shown the ability to treat seizures in pre-clinical models of epilepsy with significantly fewer side effects than currently approved anti-epileptic drugs"" [L2950]. Unfortunately, as of February 2018, GW Pharmaceuticals announced that their Phase 2a placebo-controlled study of CBDV for focal seizure did not reach its primary endpoints. They will continue to study its use in epilepsy, however, and are expanding their investigations to include its potential use in Autism Spectrum Disorder, Rett syndrome and Fragile X among others [L2949]. 

In October 2017 CBDV was given orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency for use in Rett Syndrome [L2952] and again in February 2018 for treatment of Fragile X Syndrome [L2951].",False

In animal studies, segesterone acetate was shown to be one of the most potent progestins [A37090]. It mediates progestational activity 100 times higher than that of [progesterone] [A37092]. It is commonly sold under the brand names Nestorone and Elcometrine and serves as an active component in hormonal contraceptives. It is also used as a treatment for endometriosis in South American countries. Segesterone acetate binds selectively to progesterone receptors and not androgen receptors [A37083]. Due to its rapid hepatic metabolism, segesterone acetate must be administered parenterally [A37090]. Segesterone acetate is not an orally active compound, but it is proved to be a potent anti-ovulatory agent when given in implants, vaginal rings or percutaneous gel [A37090]. 

On August 10, 2018, Annovera™ containing segesterone acetate and [ethinyl estradiol] was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first and only contraceptive that provides an entire year of protection against unintended pregnancy while entirely under a woman's control. According to the Center for Disease Control, more than 43 million women in the U.S. are at risk of unintended pregnancy, which may be associated with an elevated risk for improper prenatal care, premature and low-birth-weight infants, and physical and mental health risks [L4246]. The introduction of this new contraceptive method offers an expansion of birth control options for women while maintaining high efficacy and acceptability similar to existing shorter-acting combined hormonal methods [A37083]. In clinical trials, Annovera™ achieved a 97.3% success in pregnancy prevention [L4246]. Annovera™ is administered as a vaginal ring that is in place for 21 days and removed for 7 days each cycle. As with other hormonal contraceptives, Annovera™ carries the risk for serious cardiovascular events.",False

It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells.[A193719] FGFRs gained attention as potential therapeutic targets in selected cancers, as FGFR gene alterations were observed in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach.[A198984] Deregulated FGFR signalling pathway can lead the development of oncogenes and tumour-promoting physiological processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis, and evasion of cell death.[A193716]

In April 2020, pemigatinib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test.[L13068] Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy affecting the biliary tract and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy.[A198963] This malignancy accounts for 15% to 20% of primary hepatobiliary malignancies, which account for 13% of overall cancer-related global mortality.[A198963] With increasing research on the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug treatment, recent studies show that up to 45% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma exhibited gene rearrangements resulting in oncogenic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins.[A198963] The FDA-approved indication for pemigatinib was granted under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response in pre-marketing clinical trials. Pemigatinib is marketed under the brand name Pemazyre, and it is available as oral tablets.[L13050]",True

In clinical trials, berotralstat was shown to significantly reduce attack rates at 24 weeks compared to placebo, which was sustained through 48 weeks. Berotralstat is strictly used to prevent, but not treat, these attacks.[L26656] Previous oral therapies used for prophylaxis of HAE attacks, such as androgens, were limited by undesirable adverse effects and several contraindications.[A225121] In clinical trials, berotralstat displayed a fast onset of action, long duration of action, and acceptable tolerance in patients.[A225106]",False
